# XML_Convert_to_.txt
Python script that will iterate through all xml files in a folder and re-write it as element tag : element text

### The Basics of How It Works

* Goes through each xml file in a folder (Make sure all files in the folder are xml)
* In each xml file, it pulls out the element tag and the element text
* * also cuts out root from the printed text
* writes the tag and text as key:value in a new text file named exactly like the xml file was
